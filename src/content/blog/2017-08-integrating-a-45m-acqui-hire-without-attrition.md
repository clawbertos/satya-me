Successfully integrated a $45M acqui-hire without any talent attrition.

Acme Corp, a leading tech firm, acquired a smaller competitor for $45M to strengthen its market position. The challenge was to integrate the new team of 100 employees without losing key talent or disrupting ongoing projects.

Implemented a comprehensive integration plan focused on communication, cultural alignment, and retention. Conducted one-on-one meetings with key employees, established cross-functional integration teams, and organized team-building activities to foster collaboration. Introduced a retention bonus program tied to project milestones and performance metrics to incentivize top talent to stay post-acquisition.

Prior to the acquisition, the target company had an attrition rate of 25%. Six months post-acquisition, attrition was reduced to 5%, with no key employees leaving. Project completion rates improved by 20% due to better collaboration between the two teams, resulting in a 15% increase in overall project delivery efficiency.

Demonstrated ability to navigate complex M&A integrations successfully by prioritizing talent retention and fostering a collaborative culture. Achieved significant reduction in attrition rates and improved project delivery efficiency through proactive communication and strategic retention initiatives.
