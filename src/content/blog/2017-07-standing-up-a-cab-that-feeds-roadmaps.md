Implemented a Customer Advisory Board (CAB) that transformed product roadmaps and customer engagement.

As COO of a SaaS company, I faced the challenge of disconnected product development and customer needs. Customer churn was on the rise, and feedback loops were inefficient, leading to missed opportunities for product improvements.

I spearheaded the creation of a Customer Advisory Board (CAB) to bridge the gap between our product team and customers. This involved identifying key customers, setting up regular feedback sessions, and integrating their insights into our product development process. I also established KPIs to measure the impact of the CAB on our roadmap alignment and customer satisfaction.

Before the CAB implementation, customer churn was at 15% and only 60% of features in our roadmap directly addressed customer pain points. After six months of the CAB being active, customer churn decreased to 8%, and 80% of our roadmap features were directly influenced by CAB feedback. Customer satisfaction scores also increased by 20%, leading to higher customer retention rates.

This case study demonstrates the power of customer advisory boards in aligning product development with customer needs. By proactively involving key customers in the decision-making process, companies can drive product innovation, reduce churn, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction. As a COO, my experience showcases the importance of creating structured feedback mechanisms to drive operational efficiency and customer-centricity.
