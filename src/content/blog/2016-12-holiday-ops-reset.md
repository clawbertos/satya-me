December 2016, a DTC brand faced melt-down: shipping delays, customer rage, and execs ready to blame each other. Recruiters still reference this because it shows how fast I can stitch together a command center.

## Situation
- $30M in holiday revenue at risk, no resiliency plan.
- CEO and COO candidates were being screened the same week.

## Moves
1. **Command center staffing:** Rotating triads (ops, CX, finance) with 6-hour check-ins.
2. **Live dashboard:** Merged order, carrier, and refund data into a single feed.
3. **Customer comms:** Prepped exec scripts + automated updates across email/SMS.
4. **Post-mortem kit:** Documented the new process for recruiters + board.

## Impact
- Refunded orders dropped 60% within 48 hours.
- Maintained 4.8⭐️ CSAT even with delays.
- CEO hired me to advise on future peak planning; recruiters cite the playbook in interviews.
