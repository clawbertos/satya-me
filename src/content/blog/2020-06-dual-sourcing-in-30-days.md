Hook: Implemented dual-sourcing strategy within 30 days to mitigate supply chain risk and enhance operational resilience.

Situation: Facing overreliance on a single supplier for critical components, with lead times impacting production schedules and revenue streams. The company was vulnerable to disruptions, with potential revenue losses of $500,000 per week in case of supplier failure.

Intervention: Conducted a thorough supplier assessment and selection process within the first week. Negotiated contracts and terms with the new supplier in parallel with maintaining the existing relationship. Implemented a phased approach to onboard the new supplier while gradually reducing dependence on the existing one.

Outcome: Reduced supply chain risk by 50% within the first month. Lead times for critical components decreased by 30%, allowing for more flexibility in production planning. Revenue losses in case of supplier failure were projected to decrease to $250,000 per week.

Recruiter takeaway: Demonstrated ability to make swift yet strategic decisions in high-pressure situations. Effective risk management through supplier diversification can lead to significant reductions in operational vulnerabilities and potential revenue losses. Proven track record of implementing complex operational changes efficiently and achieving measurable results swiftly.
