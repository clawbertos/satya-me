Every recruiter I speak with eventually asks, *"Can you touch cost without triggering revolt?"* This June 2016 engagement with a hybrid SaaS/services org is the answer.

## Situation
- $75M revenue, services margin stuck at 32%.
- 60 overlapping vendors across logistics, tooling, and contractors.
- Board mandated a 10% gross-margin lift in two quarters without sacrificing NPS.

## Intervention
1. **Spend cube build:** Built a categorized spend cube in 4 days so we knew who, what, and which exec owned each vendor.
2. **Vendor council:** Formed a cross-functional council (Ops, Finance, Legal, Product) with weekly decisions on consolidation targets.
3. **Playbooked renegotiations:** Tiered vendors into Strategic, Tactical, Sunset; applied standardized negotiation briefs with KPI guardrails.
4. **Automation swaps:** Where possible, replaced services vendors with internal automation (Zapier + custom scripts) to eliminate headcount-heavy contracts.

## Outcome
- Vendor count dropped from 60 to 18 strategic partners.
- Gross margin rose 14% in 90 days, surpassing board ask.
- Zero involuntary churn; CSAT ticked up 2 points due to clearer ownership.

## Recruiter takeaway
Cost work is easy to pitch, hard to land without collateral damage. This project demonstrates that I can tighten spend, improve relationships, and story-tell it in a way that makes CEOs and boards comfortable.
