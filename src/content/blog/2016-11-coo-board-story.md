description: 'How I rebuilt the board narrative in 8 days so CEO and investors had a crisp operating story with recruit-ready metrics.'

Nov 2016, I parachuted into a founder-led company where the board packet felt like an archaeology dig. Eight days later, recruiters were citing this story when they pitched me to CEOs who needed someone to reframe the narrative fast.

## Situation
- $95M ARR company with a confusing board deck: 140 slides, no POV.
- CEO needed confidence heading into Q4 close.
- Search partners screening me wanted proof I could translate ops into a hiring-friendly board story.

## Intervention
1. **Executive interviews:** Spoke to every exec to understand their metrics + blind spots.
2. **Operating framework:** Collapsed the narrative into 4 pillars (ARR, churn, gross margin, cash).
3. **Design sprint:** Built a two-page “Operator Dashboard” with callouts for risks, wins, and hiring pipeline.
4. **Story coaching:** Prepped CEO + CFO on phrasing, giving them recruiter-friendly talking points.

## Outcome
- Board meeting hit 55 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.
- CEO received two inbound recruiter calls referencing the new operating packet within a week.
- Executive team adopted the two-page template for weekly staff.
