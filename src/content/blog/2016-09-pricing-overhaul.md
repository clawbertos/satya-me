Pricing work terrifies CEOs because it crosses product, finance, sales, and customer success. In September 2016 I led a full packaging reset that lifted ARR per customer-facing headcount 38% without churn.

## Situation
- Legacy packaging limited upsell paths.
- Sales spiffing discounts to close quarter-end gaps.
- Board demanded proof that pricing strategy had an owner before approving new headcount.

## What I did
1. **Customer panels:** Interviewed top 25 accounts to learn value language and discount habits.
2. **Cost-to-serve model:** Partnered with finance to quantify margins by segment, so we priced with intent.
3. **New packaging:** Introduced a three-tier model tied to usage thresholds and value unlocks; sunset legacy SKUs over 2 quarters.
4. **Enablement sprint:** Built calculators, objection talking points, and exec escalations inside Notion for every AE and CSM.

## Outcome
- ARR per GTM head jumped from $42K to $58K.
- Discount rate fell from 24% to 11%.
- No churn spike; adoption actually accelerated as customers understood upgrade paths.

## Recruiter takeaway
Pricing isn’t a one-time workshop—it’s a COO-owned operating muscle. This project proves I can quantify cost-to-serve, partner with GTM, and carry the narrative to the board.
