Hook:
By implementing a robust people operations framework before hiring a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), I transformed our organizational structure and set the stage for sustainable growth.

Situation:
As a rapidly expanding tech startup, we faced escalating HR challenges without a dedicated HR leadership role. High turnover rates, lack of employee development programs, and inconsistent hiring practices were hindering our productivity and culture. The need for strategic HR direction was critical to support our scaling operations and nurture our most valuable asset - our people.

Intervention:
Recognizing the urgency, I spearheaded the creation of a comprehensive people ops strategy. This involved establishing clear HR policies, implementing performance management systems, and developing training programs for managers. I also prioritized building a strong HR team to handle day-to-day operations and provide support to all departments. These actions laid the groundwork for a future CHRO to step in and lead effectively.

Outcome:
Before the intervention, our turnover rate was at 25%, and employee engagement scores were averaging at 65%. Six months post-implementation, turnover decreased to 15%, and engagement scores rose to 80%. Recruitment metrics also showed improvement, with time-to-fill reduced by 20% and a 15% increase in candidate quality. These tangible results demonstrated the impact of investing in people operations early on.

Recruiter takeaway:
Recruiters should understand the pivotal role of people ops in organizational success. By prioritizing the development of a strong people operations framework before hiring a CHRO, companies can proactively address HR challenges, boost employee retention and engagement, and set the stage for sustainable growth. Look for COOs who can drive strategic HR initiatives and create a solid foundation for future HR leadership to thrive.
