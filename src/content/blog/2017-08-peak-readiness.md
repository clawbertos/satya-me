## Situation
- Q4 was historically chaotic; we ran "readiness labs" to break the system on purpose.

## Moves
1. Simulated 2x order volume across fulfillment + CX.
2. Documented failure points, pre-staged fixes.
3. Fed learnings into hiring + inventory decisions.

## Outcome
- Q4 shipped 15% faster with 30% fewer escalations.
