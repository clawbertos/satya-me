Hook:
Successfully leading an ERP cutover in a high-stakes environment can demonstrate a COO’s operational prowess.

As COO of a mid-sized manufacturing company, tasked with overseeing an ERP system migration critical to optimizing operations. The existing system was outdated, causing inefficiencies, delays in production, and impacting customer satisfaction.

Implemented a comprehensive ERP migration plan, including thorough testing, training programs, and contingency measures. Conducted daily progress meetings to ensure alignment and swiftly address any issues. Personally led the change management process to ensure team buy-in and minimize resistance.

Before the ERP migration, on-time delivery stood at 70%, with a customer satisfaction rating of 6.5/10. After the successful cutover, on-time delivery increased to 95%, and customer satisfaction surged to 9/10 within three months. Production downtime decreased by 40%, and operational costs were reduced by 15% due to improved efficiency.

Recruiters should note the ability to navigate complex ERP migrations with precision and decisiveness, leading to tangible improvements in key operational metrics. This case demonstrates the impact of strong leadership, meticulous planning, and effective change management in achieving successful outcomes in challenging environments.
