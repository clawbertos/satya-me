Every COO interview hits the question: *"Have you ever transformed support into a revenue lever?"* August 2016 is my answer.

## Situation
- Support backlog: 1,840 tickets >24h.
- NPS stuck at 18, executives avoided customer calls.
- CCO role vacant; CEO needed someone to own the turnaround before the next renewal season.

## Intervention
1. **Ops ownership:** Moved support under the COO office for 120 days and set joint targets with Sales (expansion) and Product (defect burn-down).
2. **Playbooked tiers:** Introduced triage pods (Rescue, Stabilize, Expand) with SLAs and auto-suggested actions.
3. **Success analytics:** Instrumented health scoring that flowed straight into renewal forecasts.
4. **Talent shift:** Retained top 30% agents, reskilled them into success architects; backfilled Tier 1 with an outsourced partner.

## Outcome
- Backlog down 72% in 45 days.
- NPS climbed from 18 to 42 by quarter end.
- Expansion pipeline attributed $3.1M ARR to the new success motion.

## Recruiter takeaway
This engagement shows I can own CS, not just oversee it—from process to tooling to talent. Recruiters lean on it when CEOs ask for an operator who can calm the support floor while protecting revenue.
