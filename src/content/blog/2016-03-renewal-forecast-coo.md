description: 'How I rebuilt a $55M renewal forecast in 30 days so the CEO and recruiters could trust the number again.'

When CEO search partners ask for a "renewal whisperer," this is the story I hand them. A $55M ARR platform had burned goodwill with its board by missing retention commits three quarters in a row. The data stack wasn’t the real issue—ownership was.

## Situation
- CS, Sales, and Finance kept separate renewal spreadsheets.
- No shared health score; everything was gut feel.
- Board threatened to dock exec bonuses if Q2 retention missed again.

## What I built
1. **Renewal command center:** Embedded CS ops under the COO office for 90 days with a single renewal number updated daily.
2. **Signal hierarchy:** Codified a 5-point health score (product usage, exec alignment, support heat, expansion path, billing risk) that fed Salesforce and the board deck.
3. **CEO-ready forecast views:** Three lenses—base, upside, downside—tied to accountable owners with clear next actions.
4. **Recruiter-grade narrative:** Documented not just the metric lift but the governance changes that made it durable.

## Outcome
- 97.2% gross dollar retention (vs. 92% prior quarter).
- Forecast accuracy tightened to ±1.3%.
- Board confidence restored; CEO referenced the model in investor meetings, and recruiters began using this case to pitch me for other renewal surgeries.

## Recruiter takeaway
Renewal work is rarely about prettier dashboards. It is about governance, ownership, and cadence—exactly the levers COO recruiters want evidence of. This project proves I can take the keys, refactor the cross-functional flow, and hand back a number the board believes.
