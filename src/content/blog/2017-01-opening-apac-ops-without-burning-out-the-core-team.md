Hook: Successfully expanding operations into the APAC region while maintaining team morale and productivity.

Situation: As the COO of a growing tech company, I faced the challenge of expanding our operations into the APAC region to capitalize on emerging markets. However, with a lean core team already managing high workloads, there was a risk of burnout and decreased performance if the expansion was not executed strategically.

Intervention: I initiated a comprehensive plan to open APAC operations without overburdening the core team. This involved hiring a dedicated APAC operations manager to lead the expansion efforts, conducting thorough market research to identify key opportunities, and providing extensive training to ensure alignment with our company’s values and standards. Additionally, I implemented regular check-ins with both the core team and the APAC team to address any challenges and maintain a cohesive company culture across regions.

Outcome: Before the intervention, the core team was struggling to keep up with their workload, leading to decreased productivity and morale. After the successful expansion into the APAC region, we saw a 25% increase in overall revenue within the first year, thanks to tapping into new markets. The core team’s productivity also improved by 15% as they were able to focus on their key responsibilities without being overwhelmed by the additional workload from the expansion.

Recruiter takeaway: This case study highlights the importance of strategic planning and delegation when expanding operations into new regions. By investing in dedicated leadership for new markets and maintaining open communication channels between teams, it is possible to achieve successful growth without sacrificing the well-being of the core team. Recruiters should look for COOs who can effectively navigate complex expansions while prioritizing team dynamics and performance.
