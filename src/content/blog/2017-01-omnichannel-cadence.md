---

January 2017, we had 900 stores, a struggling digital arm, and a CEO asking if anyone could run a unified operating cadence. I owned the answer.

## Situation
- Digital revenue at 15% of total, leadership friction between store + web teams.
- Recruiters courting me for COO roles wanted proof I could connect dots at scale.

## Moves
1. **Operating calendar:** Monday CX call, Tuesday supply chain, Wednesday stores, Thursday digital, Friday exec – all tied to one metrics sheet.
2. **Unified KPIs:** Conversion, fulfillment time, NPS, and labor efficiency tracked together.
3. **Town hall:** Weekly video brief to the field outlining wins, blockers, hiring needs.

## Outcome & Recruiter Takeaway
- Lifted omnichannel conversion 18% in 8 weeks.
- Exec recruiters cite this as the "JCP cadence" whenever they pitch me for retail transformations.
