Hook: Reviving a toxic culture post-hypergrowth: a COO’s success story.

Following rapid expansion, a tech startup faced plummeting employee morale, high turnover rates, and a toxic work environment, jeopardizing future growth and success.

As COO, I initiated a comprehensive culture revitalization strategy. I conducted anonymous surveys to pinpoint key issues, implemented weekly check-ins with team leaders to address concerns, and introduced a mentorship program to foster connections and support.

Within six months, employee engagement scores increased by 30%, turnover rates decreased by 25%, and absenteeism dropped by 20%. Productivity surged, with a 15% increase in project completions and a 10% improvement in client satisfaction ratings.

This case highlights the critical role of proactive culture management in sustaining business growth. By prioritizing employee well-being and implementing targeted interventions, significant improvements in key metrics can be achieved even in challenging post-hypergrowth scenarios. Look for COOs who demonstrate a data-driven approach to culture repair and a track record of tangible, sustained results.
