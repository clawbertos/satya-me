description: 'How we stabilized an $80M post-merger portfolio company in 60 days with a rebuilt operating cadence tailored for CEOs and COO recruiters.'

Hiring managers kept asking whether I could drop into a messy post-merger stack and make it hum. January 2016 was the field proof: two SaaS companies fused without a shared operating system, churn spiking, and no single source of truth for the CEO or board.

## Situation
- ARR: $80M across two platforms, duplicate teams in product, finance, and customer success.
- KPI chaos: 47 dashboards, none trusted.
- CEO question from every recruiter: *"How quickly can you establish a unified cadence that de-risks the integration?"*

## What we built in 60 days
1. **Unified weekly business review** with five metrics (ARR delta, churn, deployment velocity, cash burn, NPS) tied to owners.
2. **Portfolio PMO** cutover: migrated 28 cross-functional projects into a single Kanban with stage gates.
3. **Operating calendar** for exec staff: Monday forecast, Wednesday delivery, Friday customers. No meetings without decisions.
4. **Data harmonization sprint:** Finance + RevOps normalized definitions, so board packets stopped debating math and focused on choices.

## Outcome
- Churn peaked at 2.8% in week 2, down to 1.1% by week 8.
- Integration backlog shrank from 143 items to 32, all with accountable exec owners.
- Board confidence restored; CEO cited the new cadence in the next earnings call and locked the next acquisition on schedule.

## Recruiter takeaway
This is the engagement I reference when a CEO or search partner wants proof that I can stabilize a merger without re-learning on the job. It shows the speed (inside 60 days) and the operator muscle (cadence, data, ownership) that board rooms want from a fractional or full-time COO.
