## Situation
- Midyear, we were 8% under plan and every exec ran their own sheet.

## Moves
1. Built a unified forecast model tied to hiring + cash.
2. Ran a 3-day alignment offsite to reassign owners.
3. Instituted a weekly "Commit vs Reality" review.

## Outcome
- Closed the year +2% over target, no surprise board calls.
