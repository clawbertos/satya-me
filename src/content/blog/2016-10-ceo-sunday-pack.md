Executive recruiters constantly ask, *"What artifact proves you keep CEOs ahead of the chaos?"* My answer is the Sunday Pack—born October 2016 when a portfolio CEO needed clarity before Monday staff and the board tap-ins.

## Situation
- Leadership team drowning in Slack threads.
- KPIs scattered across Looker, NetSuite, Salesforce.
- CEO spent Sunday night begging for updates; staff meetings devolved into status theater.

## Build
1. **Signal curation:** Picked eight metrics that actually changed decisions (pipeline delta, ARR, burn, hiring funnel, NPS, incident status, expansion pipeline, cash runway).
2. **Narrative-first template:** Page one summarized "What changed" and "What needs a decision"—no screenshots.
3. **Automation + human check:** Pull metrics via scripts every Saturday, have functional leads submit two bullets (win/risk) by noon Sunday.
4. **Distribution:** CEO, COO, CFO, and recruiters supporting the search received it (under NDA) to see the operator discipline firsthand.

## Outcome
- Staff meetings cut to 45 minutes focused on decisions.
- CEO regained Sundays with family; morale uptick was real.
- Recruiters used the pack as collateral when pitching me for other CEO/COO pairings.

## Recruiter takeaway
Artifacts win searches. This Sunday Pack shows how I keep founders and boards ahead of the curve with a repeatable operating document.
