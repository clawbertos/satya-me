Recruiters screening for COO candidates keep returning to one metric: *How fast can you unlock cash without kneecapping growth?* February 2016 delivered the answer when a hardware-enabled SaaS company carried 172 days of inventory and a revolver draw their board hated.

## Situation
- $42M revenue, negative working-cap cycle, and 11 contract manufacturers.
- Sales ops promised 4-week lead times; reality was 9+ because of batch scheduling.
- CEO mandate: free $5M+ in cash before pursuing another credit facility.

## What we did
1. **Constraint mapping:** Ran a 5-day Kaizen with sourcing, finance, and GTM to map true lead times and MOQ penalties.
2. **ABC demand coding:** Classified SKUs into risk tiers so we could run JIT on A-movers and scheduled builds on C-tier gear.
3. **Deposits + factoring:** Negotiated partial-prepay on enterprise deals and layered a light factoring program on government contracts to smooth receipts.
4. **Single command board:** Daily Slack bot published inventory turns, PO approvals, and cash unlocked so execs had one drumbeat.

## Outcome
- $6M cash released (vs. $5M goal) in 8 weeks; revolver draw paid down.
- Days inventory on hand cut from 172 to 61 without a single stock-out.
- Recruiters later cited this project when pitching me as "the operator who unlocks cash before the banker call."

## Recruiter takeaway
This is the proof CEOs ask for when they want a COO who can touch supply chain, finance, and GTM simultaneously. It shows I can de-risk working capital while keeping enterprise customers whole.
