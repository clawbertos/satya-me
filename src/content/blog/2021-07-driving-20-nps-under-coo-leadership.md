Hook: Boosting NPS by over 20 points under my COO leadership transformed our business.

Situation: As COO of a tech startup, I inherited a dire situation: our Net Promoter Score (NPS) was languishing at a dismal 15, leading to customer churn and revenue loss.

Intervention: I immediately initiated a comprehensive NPS improvement plan. We revamped our customer feedback processes, implemented a new CRM system to track customer interactions, and conducted in-depth interviews with dissatisfied customers to pinpoint pain points.

Outcome: Within six months, our NPS skyrocketed to 35, a remarkable increase of 20 points. Customer retention rates improved by 15%, leading to a 10% increase in annual revenue.

Recruiter takeaway: Recruiters should note my ability to drive tangible results in challenging environments. By implementing data-driven strategies and fostering a customer-centric culture, I successfully turned around our NPS metrics and directly impacted the company’s bottom line.
