Transformed a high-touch customer service organization into a low-touch model overnight, driving efficiency without sacrificing quality.

As COO of a digital company facing exponential growth, we were inundated with customer service requests, overwhelming our team and hindering our ability to scale. The existing high-touch model was unsustainable, risking customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Implemented a comprehensive plan to transition our customer service organization from a high-touch to a low-touch model. This involved automating repetitive tasks using AI chatbots, setting up self-service portals, and restructuring workflows to prioritize high-impact customer interactions.

Reduced average handling time per customer query from 10 minutes to 2 minutes within a week of implementation. Customer satisfaction scores improved by 20% as customers appreciated the quicker resolution times. Additionally, achieved a 30% increase in operational efficiency, allowing the team to handle a 50% increase in customer inquiries without increasing headcount.

Demonstrated the ability to drive rapid operational transformation in high-pressure environments. Proven track record of implementing scalable solutions that drive efficiency and improve customer satisfaction. Strong focus on leveraging technology to optimize processes and deliver tangible results.
