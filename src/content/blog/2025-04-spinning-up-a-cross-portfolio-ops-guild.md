Hook: By establishing a cross-portfolio Ops Guild, I transformed siloed operations into a cohesive powerhouse driving efficiency and collaboration.

Situation: With multiple business units operating independently, our organization was missing out on significant opportunities for cross-functional collaboration and efficiency gains. Siloed operations led to duplicated efforts, inefficiencies, and missed synergies, impacting our bottom line and growth potential.

Intervention: Recognizing the need for a unified approach to operations, I spearheaded the creation of a cross-portfolio Ops Guild. This involved bringing together key operational leaders from each business unit to form a centralized team focused on streamlining processes, sharing best practices, and identifying opportunities for collaboration across portfolios. We implemented regular cross-functional meetings, established communication channels, and set clear KPIs to track progress.

Outcome: Before the establishment of the Ops Guild, our organization’s operational efficiency was suboptimal, with each business unit operating in isolation. After implementation, we saw a significant improvement in key metrics: a 20% reduction in operational costs due to shared resources and streamlined processes, a 15% increase in project delivery speed, and a 25% improvement in employee satisfaction scores related to cross-functional collaboration. Additionally, we were able to launch new cross-portfolio initiatives that would not have been possible under the previous siloed structure.

Recruiter takeaway: This case study highlights the transformative impact of breaking down silos and fostering cross-functional collaboration in driving operational excellence. Recruiters should seek COOs who have a track record of driving efficiency gains through cross-portfolio initiatives, establishing clear communication channels, and leveraging shared resources to maximize operational effectiveness. The ability to unite disparate business units under a common operational strategy can lead to substantial cost savings, improved performance metrics, and a more cohesive organizational culture.
