In the midst of financial chaos, I led a strategic board retro before the finance team closed the books.

As COO of a fast-growing tech startup, our finance department was struggling to close the books on time due to operational inefficiencies. The delay was jeopardizing our ability to provide accurate financial reports to the board, leading to a lack of transparency and trust in our financial management.

I initiated a comprehensive board retro, bringing together key stakeholders from finance, operations, and leadership. We identified bottlenecks in the financial reporting process, implemented streamlined workflows, and set clear accountability measures to ensure timely book closures moving forward. Additionally, I introduced regular check-ins to monitor progress and address any emerging issues promptly.

Prior to the intervention, our finance team was consistently missing the deadline to close the books, with an average delay of 10 days. After implementing the changes following the board retro, we were able to reduce the book closure time to just 5 days on average. This improvement not only restored confidence in our financial reporting but also allowed the board to make more informed decisions based on up-to-date data.

This case study highlights the importance of proactive operational leadership in driving organizational efficiency and transparency. By taking decisive action and fostering collaboration across departments, I was able to deliver tangible results in a high-pressure environment. Recruiters should look for candidates who can navigate complex challenges with a data-driven approach and a focus on continuous improvement.
