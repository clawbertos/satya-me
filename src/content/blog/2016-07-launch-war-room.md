Product launches slip because they lack an operating owner. In July 2016 we were 30 days from a flagship platform release with 400 enterprise customers waiting and no unified plan. Recruiters still lean on this story when CEOs ask, "Who owns the war room?"

## Situation
- Launch team scattered across Product, Marketing, Support, and Enablement.
- 180 open issues, no severity rubric, no single executive drumbeat.
- Revenue target: $12M upsell in first quarter post-launch.

## Moves
1. **War-room charter:** Defined roles, daily schedule, escalation paths. I chaired the stand-up and published notes to the entire exec team.
2. **Severity matrix:** Color-coded issues with SLA expectations; anything red triggered 2-hour response windows.
3. **Customer comms pod:** Paired Support + CS to deliver proactive updates to top 50 accounts.
4. **Readiness dashboard:** Combined Jira, Salesforce, and Zendesk signals into a single Notion control tower.

## Outcome
- Launch shipped on time. First-quarter upsell hit $13.4M (+12% vs. plan).
- Issue backlog collapsed from 180 to 24 within two weeks.
- CEO credited the war room in board notes; recruiters used the doc packet as proof of my launch muscle.

## Recruiter takeaway
This is more than a Gantt chart; it's a COO standing up governance under pressure. It shows I can empower cross-functional leads, keep execs aligned, and maintain customer trust simultaneously.
