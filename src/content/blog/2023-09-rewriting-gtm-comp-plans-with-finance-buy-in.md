Hook: Transformed a struggling GTM compensation plan, increasing sales productivity by 20%.

As COO of a technology company, I inherited a GTM compensation plan that was demotivating the sales team. High turnover, missed targets, and lack of alignment with company goals were impacting revenue growth.

I conducted a thorough analysis of the existing compensation plan, identified key pain points, and collaborated closely with the finance team to redesign a new plan that incentivized desired behaviors. This involved introducing clearer performance metrics, aligning incentives with company objectives, and ensuring transparency in the calculation process.

Before the intervention, sales productivity was stagnant, with a turnover rate of 30% and missed targets in two consecutive quarters. After implementing the new GTM compensation plan, sales productivity increased by 20%, turnover decreased to 15%, and the sales team consistently achieved or exceeded targets, leading to a 15% growth in revenue within the first year.

This case study highlights the importance of aligning GTM compensation plans with company goals and ensuring finance buy-in for successful implementation. By taking a data-driven approach, collaborating cross-functionally, and focusing on incentivizing the right behaviors, significant improvements in sales performance and overall business growth can be achieved.
