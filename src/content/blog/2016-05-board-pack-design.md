Board decks rarely win COO searches, but they absolutely lose them when they ramble. In May 2016 I took over a 70-slide Frankenstein packet and replaced it with a 12-slide operator narrative anchored on decisions.

## Situation
- Growth-stage SaaS, $60M ARR, three business lines.
- Board meetings running 3.5 hours because the packet buried the signal.
- CEO asked for a COO who could "run the room" so recruiters needed proof I had the muscle.

## What changed
1. **Operator outline:** Recast the deck into four chapters—Health, Growth, Efficiency, Risk—with exactly three slides each.
2. **Decision registers:** Every slide ended with binary decisions for the board, forcing prep and accountability.
3. **Single source charts:** Connected Looker + Mosaic to auto-populate slides, eliminating midnight copy-paste rituals.
4. **Pre-read video:** Recorded a 7-minute Loom so directors could absorb context asynchronously and arrive with questions.

## Outcome
- Board meeting length dropped to 2:05 while decision throughput doubled.
- Directors complimented the cadence and later referenced it during recruiter intake calls.
- CEO delegated ongoing board ops to me, freeing him to focus on narrative.

## Recruiter takeaway
Handing a recruiter an actual board pack creates instant credibility. This engagement proves I can own the relationship, structure the story, and drive decisions before, during, and after the meeting.
