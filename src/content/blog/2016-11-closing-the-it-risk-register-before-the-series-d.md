Hook: Eliminating IT risk before a Series D funding round saved our company from potential disaster.

Situation: As COO of a tech startup preparing for a Series D funding round, we faced a critical challenge with our IT risk register. Over time, the register had become cluttered and outdated, with 150 unresolved high-priority issues, posing a significant threat to our operations and cybersecurity. This not only jeopardized our chances of securing new funding but also risked damaging our reputation and customer trust.

Intervention: Recognizing the urgency of the situation, I spearheaded a comprehensive cleanup initiative. I assembled a cross-functional team consisting of IT professionals, security experts, and project managers to tackle the backlog. We conducted a thorough review of each item in the register, prioritizing based on potential impact and feasibility of resolution. We implemented a structured action plan to address the issues systematically, setting clear deadlines and holding team members accountable.

Outcome: Through our focused efforts, we successfully closed out 90% of the outstanding IT risk register items within three months. This dramatic reduction in unresolved issues significantly improved our cybersecurity posture and operational resilience. As a direct result of this cleanup initiative, we were able to demonstrate to potential investors that we had a robust IT risk management system in place, instilling confidence in our ability to protect sensitive data and maintain business continuity. Ultimately, we secured the Series D funding round, propelling our company to the next level of growth and success.

Recruiter takeaway: This case study illustrates the importance of proactive risk management and decisive action in complex operational environments. By taking a hands-on approach to addressing critical issues, I was able to drive tangible results and safeguard the future of the company. Recruiters should look for COOs who can lead effective cross-functional teams, implement structured processes, and deliver measurable outcomes in high-pressure situations.
