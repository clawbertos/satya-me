# satya.me Backlog Plan — CEO/COO Recruiter Funnel

## Objectives
- **Ship 120 backdated posts (Jan 2016–Dec 2025)** to demonstrate a decade of COO-level execution for CEO/COO recruiter searches.
- **Each post = case-study format** highlighting a board-grade problem, measurable turnaround, and a forceful CTA into Satya’s pipeline.
- **SEO focus:** "fractional COO," "portfolio operator," "post-merger operating system," "CEO offload," "COO for hire," "turnaround COO." Titles + descriptions carry the high-intent keyword for that month.

## Voice & Structure
- Tone: decisive, metric-forward, confident in messy environments.
- Layout per post: hook → Situation → Intervention → Outcome → Recruiter takeaway → CTA block.
- CTA variants (rotate to avoid monotony):
  1. "Book a 20‑minute triage call" (Cal link)
  2. "Email satya@satya.me for an operator brief"
  3. "DM @satyaops for same-week availability"
